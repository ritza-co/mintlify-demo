Most CRM systems treat customer interactions as isolated events. Each conversation starts from scratch, losing valuable context and relationship depth over time.

This guide shows you how to build customer-specific agents in Letta that grow smarter with each interaction. Instead of generic chatbots, you'll create persistent agents that remember previous conversations, accumulate knowledge about each customer's business, and provide increasingly personalized experiences.

We'll build a customer success agent template where each new customer gets their own dedicated agent, created from the template, that researches their background, updates its memory, and sends personalized welcome emails.

<Note>
We'll use the [ADE](/agent-development-environment) to build our agents in a UI, but you can use the [Letta API / SDK](/api-reference/overview) to follow all the steps.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

To follow along, you need free accounts for the following platforms:

- **[Letta](https://www.letta.com):** To access the agent development platform
- **[Gmail](https://gmail.com):** To configure the agent's email sending capability
- **[Zapier MCP](https://mcp.zapier.com/mcp):** To set up the MCP email tool integration
- **[Exa](https://exa.ai):** To configure MCP research and LinkedIn lookup tools

## Step 1: Create an agent template

Agent templates serve as blueprints that define your agent's memory structure, tools, and behavior patterns. From the Letta dashboard, click **Templates** → **+ New template** → **Start from scratch**.

<img className="w-300" src="assets/add-template.png" alt="Creating a new agent template in the Letta dashboard" />

This launches the Agent Development Environment (ADE) with three key areas: a center chat simulator for testing, a left sidebar for configuration (template settings, tools, LLM config), and a right panel showing memory architecture with real-time context utilization.

<img className="w-300" src="assets/agent-development-environment.png" alt="Agent Development Environment interface showing chat simulator, configuration sidebar, and memory blocks panel" />

Rename your template `customer-success-agent` by clicking the **pen icon** next to the **Name** field.

<img className="w-300" src="assets/name-template.png" alt="Editing agent template name in the ADE" />

## Step 2: Set up memory blocks

Memory blocks create your agent's persistent knowledge architecture. In the ADE's right panel, in the **Core Memory** section, click **Advanced** → **+ New block** to add custom memory blocks.

The `customer` memory block stores everything your agent learns about the individual customer contact. Template variables get populated when creating agents from this template, while research findings accumulate in descriptive fields.

The `organization` memory block contains static company information that agents reference but shouldn't modify. Set as read-only to ensure consistent messaging across all customer interactions.

The `tool_use_guidelines` memory block contains instructions for how your agent should use its research and communication tools effectively.

The `tasks` memory block keeps your agent focused on relationship-building objectives while tracking progress through complex customer success workflows.

<Note>
In the `organization` memory block, replace the bracketed placeholders with your actual name and title so the agent sends emails with proper sender identification.
</Note>

### Template variables

The `{{variable_name}}` placeholders in `customer` memory blocks are populated with actual customer data when you create agents from the template and they start interacting with your customers.

## Step 3: Configure MCP tools for customer research

Tools transform your agent from a static responder into an active researcher. In the ADE's left sidebar, click **Tools** → **Tool Manager**. This opens a modal where you'll configure Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that provide external capabilities.

<img className="w-300" src="assets/mcp-options.png" alt="Tool manager modal showing MCP server configuration options" />

Your agent needs research, communication, email drafting, and email sending tools to gather customer intelligence and send personalized emails.

</Steps>
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Connecting tools to your agent

In the **Tool manager** view, you can now see both MCP servers. Click each server to view the available tools. To attach them, click the **link icon** next to the tools your agent needs:

<img className="w-300" src="assets/attach-tool.png" alt="Attaching tools to agent in Tool Manager" />

**From Exa**: Attach `web_search_exa`, `company_research_exa`, and `linkedin_search_exa`.

**From Zapier**: Attach `gmail_create_draft` and `gmail_send_email`.

## Step 4: Save your template

Once you've configured all memory blocks and tools, click the **Save** button in the ADE toolbar. This opens a version modal. Click **Save new version** to save your template for agent creation.

Your `customer-success-agent` template is now ready to create customer-specific agents.

## Step 5: Create a customer identity

Before creating agents from your template, you need to set up customer identities. In a real-world scenario, each new customer that signs up has their identity created (either manually or via API integration). For this demo, you'll create an identity for yourself to test the complete workflow.

Navigate back to the main Letta dashboard and click **Identities** in the left sidebar, then click **+ Create identity**.

In the modal that opens, configure your customer identity using the three fields:

- **Name**: Enter your own full name (for example, `[Your Full Name]`).
- **Identity Type**: Select **User** for individual customer contacts.
- **Unique Identifier**: Create a unique string to identify this customer in your system (for example, `customer_[your_name]`).

Click **Confirm** when all fields are populated.

<img className="w-300" src="assets/create-identity.png" alt="Creating customer identity with name, type, and unique identifier" />

<Note>
The unique identifier becomes crucial for programmatic agent creation when integrating with CRMs or sign-up workflows. Use a consistent naming pattern that scales across your customer base.
</Note>

## Step 6: Create an agent from the template

With your template and customer identity ready, navigate to **Agents** in the sidebar and click **+ Create a new agent**.

In the modal, locate the **Create an agent from existing template** section and click on your `customer-success-agent` template.

<Note>
When creating an agent from a template that contains memory variables, Letta prompts you to fill in the variable values before creating the agent. This is where you populate the customer-specific information, like `{{customer_name}}` and `{{customer_email}}`.
</Note>

Fill in your own customer details for testing:

<img className="w-300" src="assets/template-variables-modal.png" alt="Modal showing template variables to fill in when creating agent from template" />

Click **+ Create Agent**. Letta creates the agent and opens the ADE for your new agent instance.

You can see the agent name in the top-left corner of the ADE (for example, **customer-success-agent:1 / random-generated-name**).

<img className="w-300" src="assets/agent-from-template.png" alt="New agent created from template showing inherited memory blocks and tools" />

<Note>
Notice that the agent automatically inherits all memory blocks and tools from your template. The memory blocks now contain the populated customer information instead of template variables, and all the research and email tools have already been attached and configured.
</Note>

### Assigning the identity

In the ADE's left sidebar, click the **profile icon** next to the first field in the **Identities** section. Search for your customer identity by name, select it, then click **Update identities** to assign it to the agent.

<img className="w-300" src="assets/assign-identities.png" alt="Assigning customer identity to agent in Edit Identities section" />

## Step 7: Test the agent

Once you've set up your agent, test the complete workflow with a customer research prompt. In the ADE chat interface, enter the following:

```
Hi! Your new customer [Customer Name] ([email@example.com]) just signed up for our trial. They could benefit from our industrial automation solutions, and they're likely evaluating our platform for potential implementation.

Please research their professional background using LinkedIn and research their company to understand their business and potential needs for ACME Manufacturing's automation solutions. Update your memory blocks with your findings, then draft and send a personalized welcome email that references their background and suggests relevant ACME solutions.

Complete the full workflow: research, memory updates, email draft, and email sending. Provide a summary of your research findings and confirm when the email has been sent.
```

<Note>
Replace `[Customer Name]` and `[email@example.com]` with actual customer details for testing. Use your own email address so you can receive and review the personalized welcome email the agent sends.
</Note>

The agent will execute the workflow by using its research tools, updating memory blocks with findings, and sending a personalized welcome email. You can observe the process in real time and review the generated email output to ensure quality and personalization. Check your email inbox to see the final personalized message the agent created and sent.

<Success>
